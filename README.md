# CV_Project

## Project Description

This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset into two categories based on their ability to fly:

Can Fly (class 1): Includes images of objects that can fly, such as birds and airplanes.
Cannot Fly (class 0): Includes images of objects that cannot fly, such as frogs, deer, trucks, etc.
The main objective is to develop a CNN model that effectively discriminates between these two categories using TensorFlow/Keras, ensuring accurate model evaluation using standard classification metrics.
